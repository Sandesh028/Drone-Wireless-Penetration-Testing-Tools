# Drone Wireless Penetration Testing Tools

## Overview
This session introduces students to the tools and techniques used in wireless penetration testing on drones. The objective is to understand the vulnerabilities in drone communication systems and their implications for security. The session includes a live demonstration and hands-on exercises to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Key Takeaways
- **Understanding Wireless Threats**: Learn how wireless vulnerabilities can compromise drone operations.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Simulate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and deauthentication techniques.
- **Awareness of Ethical Hacking**: Understand the boundaries and responsibilities of penetration testing.

## What You Will Learn
- How attackers exploit vulnerabilities in drone wireless communication.
- The role of tools like `hping3`, `aircrack-ng`, and `aireplay-ng` in testing wireless security.
- The impact of breaches on the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).

## Agenda
1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of wireless vulnerabilities in drones.
2. **Live Demonstration**: Simulating a TCP SYN flood and deauthentication attack.
3. **Hands-On Activity**: Students perform guided tests using provided scripts and tools.
4. **Discussion**: Explore mitigation techniques and ethical considerations.

## Preparation
To participate in the session, ensure you have:
- A laptop with wireless testing tools installed.
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts (optional but helpful).

## Why This Matters
Drones are increasingly used in critical applications, from surveillance to delivery systems. Understanding their vulnerabilities is crucial for protecting against unauthorized access and ensuring operational integrity.
